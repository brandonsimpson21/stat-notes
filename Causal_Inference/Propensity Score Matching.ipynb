    "Propensity score matching attempts to account for covariates that predict recieving the treatment. bias arises because a difference in treatment outcome may be cause by a factor that predicts treatment rather than the treatment itself. In randomized experiments randomization enables unbiased estimation of treatment effects because by law of large numbers treatment groups are balanced on average.\n",
